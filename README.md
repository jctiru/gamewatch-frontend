## Overview

A game information and news source website. Java microservices using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud for backend and React SPA for frontend. Microservices environment is simulated as multiple containers inside a single EC2 instance.

Backend hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk with multi-docker config. Frontend assets on AWS S3. S3 bucket is behind AWS CloudFront CDN and is not directly accessible except only through AWS CloudFront by using Origin Access Identity. AWS Cloudfront SSL/TLS certificate for custom domain is provided by AWS ACM. Domain registration and DNS service handled by AWS Route53.

Frontend repo goes through TravisCI pipeline which builds the assets and uploads to S3 bucket. Backend repos also goes through TravisCI pipeline which builds and uploads the docker images to Docker Hub, then triggers a central GitlabCI pipeline which handles deployment to Elastic Beanstalk for all projects (includes other projects which are also hosted in the same single EC2 instance). Traefik is used as reverse proxy for multiple containers and to automate Let's Encrypt SSL/TLS certificate generation/management.
